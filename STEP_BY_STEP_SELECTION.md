### Step 2: Click "Next"
After selecting "Application data", the "Next" button will become enabled (turn blue).
Click it to proceed.

## üì∏ Your Current Screen:

You should see:
- API: Cloud Vision API (already selected ‚úì)
- Two options:
  - ‚óã User data (NOT THIS ONE)
  - ‚óã **Application data** ‚Üê SELECT THIS ONE

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important:

**Select "Application data"** - This will create a service account which is what you need for your backend API to access Google Vision.

**DO NOT select "User data"** - That's for OAuth and user-facing applications, not backend APIs.

## ‚û°Ô∏è After Selecting "Application data":

1. Click "Next" button
2. You'll be taken to service account creation page
3. Follow the remaining steps to download your JSON key file
